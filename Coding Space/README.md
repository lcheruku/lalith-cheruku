## Welcome to Coding Spaceü§ùüíº

Coding Space is a folder in my public repository that I would be using to solve most complex coding problems in our day-to-day life. I would provide optimal to near-optimal code while walk you through the *Problem Description*, *My Approach to Problem-Solving*, *Time and Space Complexities* etc. 

Be sure to check out the comments in each of my codes as they will take you step-by-step into the process. Additonally, I would be mentioning other important details about Coding Space here in this documentary. So Let's Beginüé¨

### My Keys to Code Efficiency:
Efficient code is essential for any programmer, it is crucial for unfolding any complications or bottlenecks & enhances areas like, 

1. Performance,
2. Low Latency,
3. Modularity,
4. Scalability,
5. Optimization etc.

To accomplish code efficiency, I would make sure

(I) My code is Readable.

(II) My code is Reusable with less room for Redundancy.

(III) My code makes appropriate choices of Data Structures, Algorithms, Loops & Control Statements.

(IV) My code has Optimal Runtime and Space Complexity.

### üìå Topics
I would be covering wide range of Problem Categories namely,

1. Programming Languages
2. Data Structures
3. Algorithms
4. Collections
5. Object-Oriented Concepts
6. Core Java Concepts
7. Data Types
8. Strings and Wrapper Classes
9. Trees & Graphs
10. Mathematics

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

* Programming Language - Java and Node.JS
* IDE - Eclipse and Visual Studio Code
* Operating System - Windows
* Version Control - Git and GitHub
